392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters."""

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_index, t_index = 0, 0

        while s_index < len(s) and t_index < len(t):
            if s[s_index] == t[t_index]:
                s_index += 1
            t_index += 1
        
        return s_index == len(s)
